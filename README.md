Data process
The test data can be generated by the codes in the data_process directory.

NEURON
we first construct a co-activation graph by adj.py.

Then, we use METIS to split the graph into subgraphs.

gpmetis transformer.layer.{}.ff.layer_1.weight num_expert
where num_expert is the number of experts.

Finally, we balance the neurons in each expert by trans_gp.py.

We train a multi-layer perceptron. The details of the implementation can be found in mlp_select_example.py.

TRAIN
run_qa_beam_search_no_trainer.py for XLNet and run_qa_no_trainer.py for others.
